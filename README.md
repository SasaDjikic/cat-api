# Vert.x API Learning Project

This repository is my practice project to explore and learn how to work with [Vert.x](https://vertx.io/). The focus is on understanding Vert.x's core concepts, implementing proper testing strategies with [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/), and integrating Dependency Injection using [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/).

## Tech Stack

- **Vert.x**: Core of the API for building reactive services.
- **JUnit 5 and AssertJ**: For testing.
- **Mockito**: For mocking dependencies.
- **Micronaut**: For Dependency Injection and application configuration.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing data.
